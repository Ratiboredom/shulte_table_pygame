### Just my fun project.

Schulte tables are tables with randomly arranged objects (usually numbers or letters) that are used to test and develop the speed of finding these objects in a certain order. Exercises with tables can improve peripheral vision, which is important for speed reading, for example.

Some things can be changed and improved:
- There is maybe no need for images of numbers and probably just font-displayed numbers can work more effectively and appear more neat
- "Play again" screen can be added so there is no need to restart the app every time
- Best solve time (record) can be stored
- Resizeable window, numbers
- Different modes of tables can be added (different sizes (3x3, 6x6) and letters instead of numbers for example)
